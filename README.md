# Hospitality-KPI-Insights---Power-BI
An end-to-end data analysis project in Power BI, transforming raw business data from 'Atlig Grands' (imaginary company) into an interactive dashboard to uncover key business insights and actionable recommendations for sales optimization.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# 🏨 Hospitality KPI Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents a **Power BI dashboard** analyzing key revenue and performance metrics for a hotel property. It is designed to support hotel managers, owners, and stakeholders in understanding business health through essential KPIs.

**Problem Statement**

**AtliQ Grands** owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.


## 📊 Project Objective

To build a clear and interactive dashboard that visualizes:
- Revenue performance
- Occupancy trends
- Booking behavior
- Room revenue efficiency
- Key industry metrics (e.g., ADR, RevPAR)

## 🎯 Key Insights

* **Importance of Key Hotel Metrics:** The initial review highlighted the critical need to include **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)** and **ADR (Average Daily Rate)** in the dashboard, as these are fundamental to the hospitality industry.

* **Weekday vs. Weekend Analysis:** It's crucial to analyze data with a **weekday versus weekend split** (with weekends being Friday and Saturday in the hotel industry) to understand if a hotel is primarily a business or leisure property.

* **Trend Analysis:** The dashboard should show **week-on-week or month-on-month trends** to help in decision-making and identify opportunities.

* **Channel-Level Breakdown:** Analyzing metrics by **booking platforms (channels)** is essential to identify channel-specific issues and understand booking origins.

* **Layered Analysis (Level 1 and Level 2):**
    * **Level 1 analysis** provides a high-level overview to identify if there's a problem (e.g., overall revenue is low).
    * **Level 2 analysis** involves "peeling the onion" to pinpoint the exact source of a problem (e.g., which city, property, or room type is performing poorly), with property-level data being very helpful.

* **Opportunity in Dynamic Pricing:** A flat ADR trend despite fluctuating occupancy suggested the hotel uses a fixed pricing strategy, indicating a significant opportunity for **dynamic pricing**, especially during peak seasons. Similarly, minimal weekday/weekend ADR differences indicated a missed opportunity for varied pricing during these periods.

* **Correlation of Occupancy and Ratings:** There's a strong correlation between **low occupancy and low average ratings**, emphasizing that online reviews significantly impact bookings. Improving service and online content accuracy can boost ratings.

* **Cancellations and No-Shows:** Low occupancy and ratings also correlate with **high cancellation rates**.

* **Promotional Strategies over Price Discrepancies:** Hotels cannot have vastly different pricing across different online channels due to price-scraping bots. Instead, the strategy should focus on **promotions** (discounts, added value) through their own channels or specific packages.


## 💡 Business Impact
